Just a warm-up!

Using control flow in python, and formulating a computation solution to a problem. And also an exploration on bisection search.

A letter game called *Hangman* decomposited to its basic functions and implemented. It's an introduction to creating functions, as well as looping mechanisms.


## [ps3](): Dictionaries, Tuples, List, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning

A word game like *Scrabble* implemented. The main goals are to work with dictionaries, an understanding on mutability, writing a program by pseudocode, testing and debugging each function in creation.
